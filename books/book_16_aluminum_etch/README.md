## Key Technical Themes

### 1. **Thermal Management as Primary Design Driver**
Aluminum's high thermal conductivity means heat dissipation is not a secondary concern—it's the central design constraint. Wafer-to-electrode temperature uniformity must be maintained to ±5°C across 300mm wafers while maintaining process recipe fidelity.

### 2. **ARDE and Aspect Ratio Compensation**
Unlike silicon etch where ARDE is an optimization problem, in aluminum interconnect it's a fundamental physics challenge. We explore feedback control systems, pressure tuning, and ion flux modulation to achieve vertical sidewalls across 1:1 to 8:1 aspect ratios.

### 3. **Multi-Material Selectivity**
Advanced interconnect stacks require simultaneous control of multiple selectivity metrics: Al/SiO₂ ratio (typically 1.5-2.5:1), Al/TiN selectivity, and Al/Cu barrier protection. These are mechanistically linked to ion energy, gas chemistry, and surface temperature.

### 4. **Residue Chemistry & Post-Etch Removal**
AlCl₃ sublimation temperature (~180°C) is critically close to process temperatures (~100°C). This creates a residue management challenge requiring in-situ heating or post-etch treatment. We analyze AlCl₃ formation kinetics, removal mechanisms, and impact on subsequent process steps.

### 5. **Production Integration**
Metal etch chambers operate in cluster tools where thermal coupling from adjacent chambers affects recipe behavior. We examine thermal interactions, wafer handling logistics, and endpoint detection strategies specific to metal etch at manufacturing scale.
